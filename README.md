# HeartChart
This is a sample app using 'bluetooth' (BLE)
<ol>
<li>I added 'Beets BLU' bluetooth library (obj-c) to a swift project
<li>It detects a paired 'Beets' Heart monitor and tracks the heart rate
<li>If you enter an age, the lower/upper guidelines are updated for age range
</ol>
Here's a sample image of what the project build would look like:
