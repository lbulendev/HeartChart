# HeartChart
This is a project with 2 sample apps using 'bluetooth' (BLE) (1 for iOS and 1 for Android).

Below is a screenshot of the iOS app.  I added Google and Facebook login buttonsas part of an interview discussion.

Notes about the iPhone project
<ol>
<li>I added 'Beets BLU' bluetooth library (obj-c) to a swift project
<li>It detects a paired 'Beets' Heart monitor and tracks the heart rate
<li>If you enter an age, the lower/upper guidelines are updated for age range
</ol>
Here's a sample image of what the project build would look like:
